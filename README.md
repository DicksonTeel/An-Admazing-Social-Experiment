# Welcome to an Admazing Social Experiment
I made this website for the sole purpose of containing ads to conduct an ongoing social experiment.  I grew curious if, in our adblocking society, there were people who would allow ads for perceptively moral reasons? During the lifespan of this website, all revenue gained from ads will be going towards a large number of charities.[^1]

[^1]: ***The only exception being any money that is required to enable/sustain this site***

In the name of transparency; all charities that receive funds and the amount of money they have received will be listed on a separate page accessible through a navigation bar at the top of the main testing screen, and the total amount of money donated will be included at the top of that page.
